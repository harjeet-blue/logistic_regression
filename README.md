## logistic regression
Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.

## Feature Extraction
Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in your data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which you are interested.

Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of many models, especially linear algorithms like linear and logistic regression.

Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:

Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.
Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.
Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster.
